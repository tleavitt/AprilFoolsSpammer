April Fools Text Spammer
===============

Uses textbelt's API to send SMS messages to all your friends from randomly generated phone numbers.
I encoded my name into the timing between the texts and challenged my friends to figure out who 
was inundating them with all these annoying SMSs. Once they figured it out I'd remove their number from the list.
